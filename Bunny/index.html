                <i> Bunnies make great pets.</i>
                <br> In general rabbits need appropriate housing, exercise,
                 socialisation and a specific diet for good welfare. Some breeds of rabbits, particularly the longer haired rabbits, 
                 may require daily grooming. It is important that you understand all the requirements for caring for a rabbit before 
                 you buy one.
                 <br>

                <i> Rabbits generally live for 5 to 8 years depending on their environment and breed, but they can live for as long as
                 12 years. If you decide to have a pet bunny, make sure you are prepared to care for them that long. </i>
